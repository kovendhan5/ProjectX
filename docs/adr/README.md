# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Use ADRs to capture significant technical decisions, the context that led to them, and the consequences of the chosen path. Follow this lightweight template for each entry:

```
# ADR X: Title

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded
- **Context:**
  - Problem statement and constraints.
- **Decision:**
  - Chosen approach with rationale.
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive, negative, and neutral effects.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Option A: pros/cons
  - Option B: pros/cons
```

Store ADRs as sequentially numbered markdown files (e.g., `0001-choose-ledger-platform.md`). Update status when decisions evolve and link related ADRs to maintain traceability.
