# Documentation Hub

Use this directory to curate all project documentation. Key references include:

- `PRD.md`: Core product requirements.
- `architecture/`: Context, component, data-flow, and deployment guidance.
- `roadmap.md`: Milestones, releases, and dependency tracking (to be populated).

Add API references, compliance guides, onboarding manuals, and meeting notes as the program evolves. Keep content cross-linked so contributors can trace decisions from vision through execution.
