# Documentation Hub

Use this directory to curate all project documentation. Key documents include:

- `PRD.md`: Core product requirements.
- `architecture/`: Technical diagrams, sequence flows, and deployment topology.

Add API references, compliance guides, onboarding manuals, and meeting notes as the program evolves.
