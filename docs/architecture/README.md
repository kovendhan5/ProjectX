# Architecture Playbook

Use this folder to assemble evolving architectural guidance. Start with the curated references below:

- `system-context.md`: External actors, trust boundaries, and high-level data exchanges.
- `component-overview.md`: Logical services, responsibilities, and integration contracts.
- `data-flow.md`: Narrative sequences for onboarding, custody transfer, billing, reporting, and recalls.
- `deployment-topology.md`: Environment strategy, hosting layout, and operational tooling.
- `security-model.md`: Identity, encryption, monitoring, and compliance controls.

Add container and deployment diagrams, smart contract specifications, integration contracts, and infrastructure topology as designs mature. Keep artifacts versioned alongside design decisions for auditability.
