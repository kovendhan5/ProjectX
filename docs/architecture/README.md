# Architecture Playbook

Use this folder to assemble evolving architectural guidance. Start with the curated references below:

- `system-context.md`: External actors, trust boundaries, and high-level data exchanges.
- `component-overview.md`: Logical services, responsibilities, and integration contracts.
- `data-flow.md`: Narrative sequences for onboarding, custody transfer, billing, reporting, and recalls.

Add container and deployment diagrams, smart contract specifications, and infrastructure topology as designs mature. Keep artifacts versioned alongside design decisions for auditability.
